## Data Structures

### A 1: Dynamic Memory Management in C

#### 10 points

Consider allocating space for an array of arrays, where each of the individual lengths of the different one dimensional arrays may differ. For example, we might want 5 arrays, which have lengths 10, 5, 20, 100 and 50, respectively. Write a function `makeArray` that takes in an array of integers itself and the length of that array \(so for the example above the first parameter would be the array storing 10, 5, 20, 100 and 50 and the second parameter would have a value of 5\) and allocates space for an array of arrays where each of the individual arrays have the lengths specified by the values of the input array. Before returning a pointer to the array of arrays, the function should store 0 in every element of every array allocated.

```c
int** makeArray(int* lengths, int numarrays)
{
  // your code
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Solution" %}
```c
int** makeArray(int* lengths, int numarrays)
{
  int** array = malloc(sizeof(int*)*numarrays);
  int i;

  for (i=0; i<numarrays; i++)
    array[i] = calloc(lengths[i], sizeof(int));

  return array; 
}
```

_**Grading:**_ **3 pts** initial malloc, \(1 pt for **, 1 pt for sizeof\(int**_**\), 1 pt**_ **numarrays\) could use calloc as well.** 2 pts **for loop** 4 pts **for allocating each array \(2 pts\) and zeroing it out \(2 pts\), obviously calloc does this faster, but you can also malloc and run a loop inside a loop...** 1 pt\*\* for the return

### A 2: Linked Lists

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Question" %}
#### 10 points

Consider storing an integer in a linked list by storing one digit in each node where the one’s digit is stored in the first node, the ten’s digit is stored in the second node, and so forth. Write a _**recursive function**_ that takes in a pointer to the head of a linked list storing an integer in this fashion and returns the value of the integer. Assume that the linked list has 9 or fewer nodes, so that the computation will not cause any integer overflows. \(For example, 295 would be stored as 5 followed by 9 followed by 2.\) Use the struct shown below:

```c
typedef struct node
{
  int data;
  struct node* next;
} node;

int getValue(node *head)
{
  // your code
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Solution" %}
```c
typedef struct node
{
  int data;
  struct node* next;
} node;

int getValue(node *head)
{
  if (head == NULL)
    return 0;

  return head->data + 10*getValue(head->next);
}
```

_**Grading: 2 pts check head == NULL, 1 pt ret 0 \(give full credit if base case is LL size 1\), 1 pt return, 1 pt access head-&gt;data, 1 pt add, 1 pt 10\*, 1 pt rec call, 2 pts parameter**_

### A 3: Stacks/Queues

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Question" %}
#### 5 points

Consider modeling cars lining up at a traffic light in a simulation. Would it be better to utilize a stack in the simulation or a queue, to store the cars? Clearly explain your choice.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Solution" %}
A queue would be better. At a standard traffic light, the earlier a car gets to the light, the earlier the car gets to go through the light. Traffic works in this "fair" way - first in, first out.

In thinking about designing this system, we would have each road coming into a traffic light stored as a queue. If a particular light changes from red to green at some point in time, then the cars would get dequeued from that road/light pair and each one would potentially get enqueued into the next queue representing the road/light pair they were traveling to next. A good simulation would be able to handle some of this movement in parallel, carefully keeping track of time and would identify areas of bottlenecks. Namely, if a queue fills up and another car wants to enter the queue, it actually won't get to do so, since it'll get stuck at the previous light, even though it's green! \(More than likely all UCF students who drive cars on campus have experienced this wonderful phenomenon.\)

_**Grading: 0 pts if the answer is stack. 2 pts for saying queue, 3 pts for the explanation. The explanation can be as brief as the second sentence in this solution. The second paragraph is further explanation not required for full credit.**_
